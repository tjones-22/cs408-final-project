# Closet Inventory and Outfit Matching App

## Project Specification

### General Theme

The project is a web-based application designed to manage a personal wardrobe by organizing clothing items and generating outfit combinations. The app will help users keep track of their clothing inventory and discover new ways to mix and match their outfits. It will also allow users to visualize how different clothing items look together and receive outfit suggestions.

### Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use platform where users can upload their clothing items and receive automated suggestions for outfit combinations. The app will save time and effort for users who want to organize their closet or are looking for new outfit ideas. It will serve as a digital wardrobe that users can update, customize, and explore anytime.

The application will also provide features such as categorizing clothing by type (e.g., shirts, pants, dresses), filtering by color or season, and tagging items for quicker searches. The outfit matching feature will leverage algorithms to suggest coordinated outfits from the existing wardrobe. Users will also be able to save their favorite outfit combinations for future reference.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this application includes fashion enthusiasts, individuals looking to organize their wardrobes efficiently, and anyone interested in maintaining a digital inventory of their clothing. Additionally, it is ideal for people who frequently struggle with deciding what to wear or want a more streamlined way to plan outfits.

### Data Management

The app will manage the following types of data:

User Profiles: Basic user information and preferences.

Closet Inventory: Uploaded images of clothing items with associated metadata (e.g., category, color, season, brand, tags).

Outfit Combinations: Pre-generated and user-created outfits stored as collections of clothing items.

User Preferences: Data about favorite outfits, most worn items, and outfit rating (if implemented).

Outfit Suggestions: Dynamically generated combinations based on user input and stored wardrobe data.

Stretch Goals

To enhance the functionality and appeal of the app, the following stretch goals are considered:

- Upload pictures of clothing items (from the user) and store in closet db
- Search for clothes to create outfits
- Name and describe clothing items and outfits
- Delete or update outfits and clothes

### Project Scope

This project will be built using Next.js for the frontend and a backend powered by AWS for the backend. The application will prioritize a responsive and intuitive design, with smooth navigation between sections and easy uploading of images. The focus will be on providing a fluid and user-friendly experience while keeping performance and scalability in mind.
